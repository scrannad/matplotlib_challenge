# Pymaceuticals, Inc

## Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Analysis
- The most effective drug regimens were Ramocane and Capomulin which both showed significantly decreased tumor volume over the 45 day testing period compared with the placebo.
- Least effective drug regimens were Ketapril followed by Naftasol and Stelasyn. These drug regimens showed a mean tumor volume greater than the placebo.
- The sex of the mice was relatively balanced with 51% male and 49% female mice across the study. 
- Deeper analysis of Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin showed consistent results across the sample mice with all four drugs. There was only one outlier in the Capomulin study and zero outliers in the other three drug regimens. 
- Further evaluation of tumor volume vs mouse weight in the Capomulin sample showed a very strong positive correlation (r-value of 0.84) between mouse weight and tumor volume. Further investigation would be helpful in evaluating if increased mouse weight has a causal relationship with tumor growth.
